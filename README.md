# HTML-AND-CSS
These are the html and css files that I made while learning them from Youtube channel of Quinton Watt HTML5 and CSS3 tutorials. 


HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is used to create the structure and content of a webpage.
Most HTML elements contain opening and closing tags with raw text or other HTML tags between them.
HTML elements can be nested inside other elements. The enclosed element is the child of the enclosing parent element.
Any visible content should be placed within the opening and closing '<body>' tags .
Headings and sub-headings, '<h1>' to '<h6>' tags, are used to enlarge text.
'<p>', '<span>' and '<div>' tags specify text or blocks.
The '<em>' and '<strong>' tags are used to emphasize text.
Line breaks are created with the '<br>' tag.
Ordered lists ('<ol>') are numbered and unordered lists ('<ul>') are bulleted. '<li>' is list item.
Images ('<img>') and videos ('<video>') can be added by linking to an existing source.
