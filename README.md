# HTML-AND-CSS
These are the html and css files that I made while learning them from Youtube channel of Quinton Watt HTML5 and CSS3 tutorials. 

<!--
HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and is used to create the structure and content of a webpage.
Most HTML elements contain opening and closing tags with raw text or other HTML tags between them.
HTML elements can be nested inside other elements. The enclosed element is the child of the enclosing parent element.
Any visible content should be placed within the opening and closing '<body>' tags .
Headings and sub-headings, '<h1>' to '<h6>' tags, are used to enlarge text.
'<p>', '<span>' and '<div>' tags specify text or blocks.
The '<em>' and '<strong>' tags are used to emphasize text.
Line breaks are created with the '<br>' tag.
Ordered lists ('<ol>') are numbered and unordered lists ('<ul>') are bulleted. '<li>' is list item.
Images ('<img>') and videos ('<video>') can be added by linking to an existing source.

The <table> element creates a table.
The <tr> element adds rows to a table.
To add data to a row, you can use the <td> element.
Table headings clarify the meaning of data. Headings are added with the <th> element.
Table data can span columns using the colspan attribute.
Table data can span rows using the rowspan attribute.
Tables can be split into three main sections: a head, a body, and a footer.
A table's head is created with the <thead> element.
A table's body is created with the <tbody> element.
A table's footer is created with the <tfoot> element.
All the CSS properties you learned about in this course can be applied to tables and their data.
